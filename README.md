# News Site

My project are about news about paper flowers which is a new interest of mine. The assignment was to do a news page of any given topic.

## The problem

There were so many issues with the flex box and the responsive design, which I still haven't wrapped my head around yet. I googled solutions and I think I did the code right but I must have missed something. In this project we only used HTML and CSS to learn the basic structures of a webdevelopement.
